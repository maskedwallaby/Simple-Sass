<h1 id="simple-sass-wp">Simple Sass WP</h1>
<p>Hi. I&#39;m a starter theme called Simple Sass. I&#39;m a theme based on Automattic&#39;s Underscores them, and I&#39;m meant for hacking. Don&#39;t use me as a parent theme, but flex me like a piece of putty. You know you want to.</p>
<p>My CSS is Sass-based and based on a simplified version of the BEMit methodology. That&#39;s why you downloaded me, right?</p>
<ul>
<li>A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.</li>
<li>A helpful 404 template.</li>
<li>Custom template tags in <code>inc/template-tags.php</code> that keep your templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication.</li>
<li>Some small tweaks in <code>inc/template-functions.php</code> that can improve your theming experience.</li>
<li>A script at <code>js/navigation.js</code> that makes your menu a toggled dropdown on small screens (like your phone), ready for CSS artistry. It&#39;s enqueued in <code>functions.php</code>.</li>
<li>Smartly organized starter CSS in <code>the /sass/ directory</code> that will help you to quickly get your design off the ground.</li>
<li>Licensed under GPLv3 or later. :) Use it to make something cool.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>== Compiling SASS ==</p>
<p>If you are not using a build tool, either GUI or CLI-based, you can use the Sass command line to compile the sass files found in this theme. Here’s the command you’ll want to use:</p>
<pre><code>sudo sass --watch sass/style.scss:style.css
</code></pre><p>Sudo is necessary to overwrite whatever previous style.css file already exists in the main directory. All of your other sass files should be imported into sass/style.scss.</p>
<p>That said, there&#39;s no shame in using GUI tools. <a href="https://prepros.io/">Prepos</a>, <a href="http://koala-app.com/">Koala</a>, and <a href="http://scout-app.io">Scout</a> are some great free options. At work, I use <a href="https://codekitapp.com">CodeKit</a>, but it&#39;s Mac-only. Then of course there&#39;s [Gulp].) :)</p>
<p>Now you&#39;re ready to go! The next step is easy to say, but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme. :)</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
